[["testing.html", "2 Testing 2.1 Why should you test? 2.2 What are unit tests?", " 2 Testing 2.1 Why should you test? Suppose an imaginary programmer named Grace has created a package and has been using it for a while, but she decides shed like to modify one function to improve it. She modifies her function, tests it a bit, and then publishes a new version of the package. Yet two weeks later, another imaginary programmer named Carlos discovers that the changes she made created a bug in another function in the package! This situation is very annoying, especially if Carlos has no idea what has caused the bug or how to fix it. Unfortunately, its also an extremely common problem. The solution to problems like this is to test your package systematically and automatically. If Grace had rigorously tested the entire package before publishing it, Carlos would never have had to deal with the new bug- Grace would have found out immediately. In other words, a good principle in package development is to make sure your code fails as fast as possible, so you can find out and fix it. Of course, all programmers test their code, but not everyone tests systematically and automatically. 2.2 What are unit tests? Tests compare the expected output of a block of code to its actual output. For example, the following test tests whether the generalized square root function actually returns \\(2\\) as the square root of \\(4\\). expect_equal(general_sqrt(4), complex(real = 2, imaginary = 0)) Unit tests usually run on the computer of the developer who is modifying a package and also should run automatically upon building a package. Well talk a little more about how exactly to create tests below, but hopefully this makes the general concept clear (youve also probably been using the general concept as you program). 2.2.1 Setting up the testing environment Creating unit tests is actually quite easy, thanks to a package called testthat which works in combination with usethis. To begin, you should run the following command in your favorite IDE, or even in the R Gui: usethis::use_testthat() This will do a couple of things. First, it will add testthat to the Suggests part of the DESCRIPTION, which will help other collaborators know to use testthat when modifying/working on the package. It will also create a tests/testthat directory in your project, as well a file called test/testthat.R, as shown below. 2.2.2 Expectations Before discussing how to write unit tests, we need to properly describe an expectation. An expectation tests whether the actual output of a single function call is what the developer expected. The testthat package has a number of functions which compare outputs to expected values. When calling one of these functions, one of two things can happen: If the actual output matches the expectation, nothing will happen! If the actual output does not match the expectation, it will throw an error. For example, expect_equal() uses the base R function all.equal() to check whether an output is (approximately) equal to an expectation. In the following code, the first function call will do nothing - the second function call will throw an error, displayed below. library(testthat) testthat::expect_equal(2, 2) testthat::expect_equal(2, 4) Heres an (abbreviated) list of the expectation functions: expect_equal, as aforementioned, checks equality using the all.equal() base function. expect_identical checks equality using the identical() base function. Generally, its better to use expect_equal() because lots of R functions use numerical approximations which will cause expect_identical to fail when you dont want it to. expect_match, expect_output, expect_message, expect_warning, and expect_error all respectively test whether a string, output, warning, or error match a regular expression. For example, the following two expectations functions will not throw errors: testthat::expect_match(&#39;hello1234&#39;, &#39;hello&#39;) testthat::expect_warning(sqrt(-2), &#39;NaNs produced&#39;) The tests do not fail because (i) hello1234 contains hello and (ii) the error message produced by sqrt(-2) contains the phrase NaNs produced. expect_is tests whether an object inherits from a class, specified in quotes. For example, the following test passes: testthat::expect_is(sqrt(2), &#39;numeric&#39;) expect_true and expect_false respectively expect a statement to evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. 2.2.3 Structure and Location of Unit Tests Each unit test (which is written in an R script) should use a couple of expectations to test a single core function. It should use the function test_that() (from the testthat package). test_that() takes two parameters: a string, which describes the test, and a couple of expectations, surrounded by curly braces. For example, the following code will test whether the general_sqrt() function from the devex package returns a complex number. test_that(&quot;Returns complex number&quot;, { expect_is(general_sqrt(-2), &#39;complex&#39;) expect_is(general_sqrt(2), &#39;complex&#39;) expect_is(general_sqrt(0), &#39;complex&#39;) }) Multiple tests with similar functions should be put in the same file, and those test files must be put in the tests/testthat/ directory. Moreover, their name must start with the word test - this will help R automatically run your tests for you. For example, in the devex package, there are two very simple helper functions (general_sqrt() and loss()) and one moderately complex function (scalep()). As a result, the devex package has exactly two testing files: one called testhelpers, which tests the helper functions, and another called testscalep, which tests the scalep() function. The testhelpers file looks like this: library(devex) context(&quot;generalized sqrt and loss&quot;) # Generalized sqrt --------------------------------------- test_that(&quot;Returns complex number&quot;, { expect_is(general_sqrt(-2), &#39;complex&#39;) expect_is(general_sqrt(2), &#39;complex&#39;) expect_is(general_sqrt(0), &#39;complex&#39;) }) test_that(&quot;Returns correct sqrt&quot;, { expect_equal(general_sqrt(-1.53), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(1.53))) expect_equal(general_sqrt(-2), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(2))) }) test_that(&quot;Warnings for vectors of length &gt; 1&quot;, { expect_warning(general_sqrt(c(2, 0))) expect_warning(general_sqrt(c(-2, 0, 2)), &#39;NaNs produced&#39;) }) # Loss --------------------------------------------------- test_that(&quot;Returns correct loss&quot;, { expect_equal(loss(0, 3), 9) expect_equal(loss(c(1, 1, 1), c(1, 2, 3)), c(0, 1, 4)) expect_equal(loss(c(-1, -5, -2), c(0, 0, 0)), c(1, 25, 4)) }) Each test file, as demonstrated above, needs to load the package of interest (using library() is fine) and also should supply a string which succinctly describes the general purpose of all of the tests in the test file to the context() function. You can run all of the tests in the test/testthat directory by running the following devtools function: devtools::test() If any test throws an error, R will report two things. First, it will report the string given in the test which was given to the test_that() function call. Second, it will report the filename of the test file as well as the line of code that threw an error. For example, running the above tests yields the following result: This indicates that line 18 of testhelpers.R failed in the test Warnings for vectors of length &gt; 1. Looking at the test code reveals that the general_sqrt() function does not return a warning for positive vectors of length greater than one. expect_warning(general_sqrt(c(2, 0))) To fix this, it might be worth adding in an extra line or two which ensures that the input to general_sqrt() is as it should be (to prevent users from getting unexpected results). 2.2.4 Writing Good Tests Good tests have a couple of characteristics. First, good tests have high coverage, meaning that they test a large percentage of the lines of code of the package. For example, the code for the general_sqrt() function is as follows: # This function takes the complex square root of real numbers general_sqrt &lt;- function (x){ # Issue warning for longer vectors if (length(x) &gt; 1) { warning(&#39;Argument of general_sqrt has length greater than 1&#39;) } # Return the normal square root if x &gt; 0 if (x &gt; 0 || x == 0){ return(complex(real = sqrt(x), imaginary = 0)) } # Else return the complex square root else { return(complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(-x))) } } The following test has low coverage for the general_sqrt() function: test_that(&quot;Returns correct sqrt&quot;, { expect_equal(general_sqrt(-1.53), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(1.53))) expect_equal(general_sqrt(-2), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(2))) }) because it only tests whether general_sqrt() returns the correct square root for negative numbers. This test thus only covers half of the code in general_sqrt(), because the mechanism for dealing with nonnegative numbers is entirely separate. The following test is a better example, because it tests both positive and negative numbers. test_that(&quot;Returns correct sqrt&quot;, { expect_equal(general_sqrt(1.53), complex(real = sqrt(1.53), imaginary = 0)) expect_equal(general_sqrt(-2), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(2))) }) Second, its important to remember that coverage is only important because tests with high coverage tend to test all the different functionalities of a package. Its possible to have tests which have very high coverage but arent great tests. Consider the following example. print_it &lt;- function(text){ print(&#39;hello&#39;) } testthat::expect_warning(print_it(&#39;hi&#39;), NA) ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; This expectation has 100% coverage because it will run every line of code (the expectation will also pass because no warning will be thrown). However, its not sufficient alone because it doesnt actually test whether print_it returns the desired output: in this case, print_it will always print hello. In other words, the expectation does not test all of the functionality of the function. Third, tests should run relatively quickly, if possible. Sometimes, its okay to maximize coverage even if you dont test every single functionality to save time, because usually high coverage ensures you test most of the functionality of the package. This is particularly true because lots of integrated testing software (which well discuss in integrated tests) will not be able to easily run tests which take too long. More on that later. Fourth, tests should be clear to the reader, because sometimes there are bugs in tests too. If others eventually help develop or maintain your packages, theyll want to know what it means when a test fails. Moreover, for large packages, you yourself may have trouble remembering the exact details of every test youve written. Thus, your tests should return clear error messages and be readable. For example, the following test is a bad example, for two reasons: sigmoid &lt;- function(x, a, b){ return(exp(a*x)/(exp(a*x) + b)) } test_that(&#39;sigmoid output&#39;, { expect_equal(sigmoid(0.3068528, 1, 1.3591409), 0.5, 10^-7) }) The string sigmoid output does not describe the purpose of the test, which is to test the precision of the sigmoid output. This means that if the test fails, it will be hard to tell whats wrong. Additionally, the purpose of the test is not clear to begin with - what do the seemingly random decimals mean? At the very least, its probably worth putting comments in explaining the point of the test, as shown below. sigmoid &lt;- function(x, a, b){ return(exp(a*x)/(exp(a*x) + b)) } test_that(&#39;test sigmoid precision&#39;, { # Check sigmoid(ln(e/2), ln(e/2), e/2) is very close to 1/2. expect_equal(sigmoid(0.3068528, 1, 1.3591409), 0.5, 10^-7) }) This test is a bit more interpretable/readable and delivers a better error message. 2.2.5 Automated Checking The usethis::test() function is pretty nice, but all it does is run your unit tests - it doesnt check everything else in your package. Thankfully, the devtools::check() function fills this gap. devtools::check() Running the check function will ensure your documentation is up to date, automatically run all of your unit tests, and even check your code for common problems. It will also create a new directory called Man within your package folder, which will later be populated with the help files for your functions. Note that even if your package passes all of its tests, you might still see additional warnings for other reasons, as exemplified below: Although its not necessary to understand every check that the check function runs, its worth noting that every check it performs is relatively important, and if it signals any warnings or errors, its definitely worth fixing them. Its also probably worth fixing any notes it issues. If youre curious, you can read more about what each type of check in the automated check does here. 2.2.6 Bonus: The goodpractice Package The aforementioned automated checking system for R is pretty good, but there is a slightly more comprehensive version: the goodpractice package. The goodpractice package has an informative name - the entire purpose of the package is to check whether your package follows proper package development conventions and procedures (i.e. whether your package follows good practices). For example, running the goodpractice package on the devex package yielded the following helpful results: Lets run through the key points of using goodpractice below. To install the goodpractice package, just run the following command in the R console: install.packages(&#39;goodpractice&#39;) Once youve installed the goodpractice package, you basically only need to use a single function from it: the gp() or goodpractice() function (which call the same code). This function will run comprehensive automated checks on your package, and it takes exactly one input, the path of your built package. However, its important to note that the path of your built package is not identical to the path of the repo containing it. For example, I work on the devex package in /Users/name/Documents/R/packageguidelines/devex, but the built package lives at another location. For goodpractice() to work, you need to use this latter path. If you dont know what the path is, you can use the system.file function to retrieve it for you, as demonstrated below. # Retrieve path package_path &lt;- system.file(package = &#39;devex&#39;) # Check package library(goodpractice) gp(package_path) And thats it! The goodpractice package is a bit picky, so its okay to leave a few concerns unresolved, but in general it gives good advice. If youre diligent, you might eventually see a result like this: which signals that your package conforms to all good practices. Lastly, although its beyond the scope of this guide, you ought to know that you can create custom checks using the goodpractice package, as documented here. [up to here 2022] 2.2.7 Tips and Tricks When testing, there are a couple of key principles to keep in mind: You want to expose bugs as quickly as possible so they dont create even larger headaches down the road! As Christopher Gandrud puts it, testing is all about failing faster. To this end, you should continuously test your packages. Make sure your tests cover the package code and also test all of the key functionality of the package. In an ideal world, a package should pass all of its tests only if all of its core functionality is bug-free. Test names, organization, and error messages must be descriptive and easy to understand. One of the main purposes of tests is to inform you where your code is failing, and to understand that, you need informative error messages. Otherwise, you will find yourself spending hours traversing your code to find bugs. The devtools cheatsheet, linked here, references a lot of the key components of the testthat package.
